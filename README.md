# Arduino-Buzzer
Level-3-- Create or find a song online and use arrays to store the notes and durations. Then add a light show. The lights can be linked to a specific tone or you can just make a random colour.
Level-4-- Menu system. Create a menu on the monitor that gives the user an option between 3 songs. Have each song and the menu stored in different methods where the only line in your main function is runMenu();
